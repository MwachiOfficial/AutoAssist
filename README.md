# AutoAssist
## Overview
AutoAssist is a command-line application designed to manage cars, their maintenance records, and associated comments. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on cars, maintenance records, and comments.

# Features
Car Management: Add, view, update, and delete car information.
Maintenance Management: Record and manage maintenance activities for each car.
Comment Management: Add, view, update, and delete comments related to maintenance activities.
Installation
Clone the repository:


## cd AutoAssist
## Set up the virtual environment:


python -m venv venv

Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
## Set up the database:
Ensure car_management.db is created and the tables are set up with the required schema. You can use the following script to set up the tables:

## python

import sqlite3

CREATE_CARS_TABLE_QUERY = """
CREATE TABLE cars (
    vin TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    make TEXT,
    model TEXT,
    year INTEGER
);
"""

CREATE_MAINTENANCE_TABLE_QUERY = """
CREATE TABLE maintenance (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    car_vin TEXT,
    maintenance_type TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    date_performed TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (car_vin) REFERENCES cars (vin)
);
"""

CREATE_COMMENT_TABLE_QUERY = """
CREATE TABLE comment (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    maintenance_id INTEGER,
    comment TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (maintenance_id) REFERENCES maintenance (id)
);
"""

with sqlite3.connect("car_management.db") as conn:
    conn.execute(CREATE_CARS_TABLE_QUERY)
    conn.execute(CREATE_MAINTENANCE_TABLE_QUERY)
    conn.execute(CREATE_COMMENT_TABLE_QUERY)
